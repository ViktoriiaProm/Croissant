    <h1>Multiple Page Hosting</h1>
    <p>Create a new Git repository called "Croissant" with 3 pages, index.html, photo.html and contact.html. Add some
        text on
        the index and contact pages, add a photo on the photo.html page and publish it to Netlify. Each page should link
        to each
        other. Then, add some CSS, change the background color of the website and deploy it again to Netlify. Deploy
